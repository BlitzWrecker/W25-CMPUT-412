<h1>Demos</h1>

<h2>Straight Line Demo</h2>

  The video above shows the Duckiebot driving straight in a 2-meter straight line. This video was recorded after calibrating the wheels.
  Even after calibration, we can still see the Duckiebot deviating from the straight line. This can be due to multiple reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Duckiebot's wheels are not perfectly aligned.</li>
  <li>The rubber tire on the wheels are malformed.</li>
  <li>The mat is uneven.</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lane Following Demo</h2>

  The video above shows the Duckiebot driving straight in a 2-meter straight line. This video was recorded after calibrating the camera.
  The Duckiebot sometimes follows the lane, and sometimes it follows the center line. The Duckiebot deviates from the lane and also makes adjustments when it encounters a turn in the track.
  The TAs explained some potential causes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Network delays. </li>
  <li>The lane indicators (the white and yellow tapes) start bending on turns. </li>
  <li>The carpet may also affect how the Duckiebot "interpret" the lane. </li>
</ul>
